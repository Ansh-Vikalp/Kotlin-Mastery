## 🤖 Getting Started

To start learning Kotlin, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Kotlin-Mastery.git
```
## 🏗️ How to Use
Browse through the directories and open each file to read the code and comments.
Follow along with the exercises, and try to complete them on your own.
Check the provided solutions to ensure you're on the right track.
Experiment with the code by making modifications or adding your own logic.
For example, you can run the Kotlin files using the Kotlin compiler:

```bash
kotlinc filename.kt -include-runtime -d output.jar
java -jar output.jar
```
Or directly use the Kotlin REPL for quick experiments:

```bash
kotlinc-jvm
```
## 📲 Focus on Android Development
While this repository is a complete guide to learning Kotlin, there is a special focus on Kotlin for Android Native Development. Look for files under `AndroidBasics` to get hands-on with Kotlin in the context of Android apps.
